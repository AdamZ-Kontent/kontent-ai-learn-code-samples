# Kontent.ai Learn - Code Samples

This repository contains code samples used in [Kontent.ai Learn](https://kontent.ai/learn/), the educational portal for Kontent.ai.

## How To Contribute

Check out our [guidelines on writing code samples and versioning them](https://kontent-ai.atlassian.net/l/cp/W2ncVL2R).

Create a pull request from your branch or fork with the proposed changes and additions.

The file names of the code sample files are used for content item names and codenames. If you're adding code samples for a single scenario AND for multiple technologies or programming languages, make sure to name the files the same. For example, `scenario.ts` and `scenario.cs`. This way, they will be grouped in the CMS.

If your code changes are merged to the master branch, the new code is automatically added to the Kontent.ai Learn project.

The code changes will NOT  automatically appear in <https://kontent.ai/learn/>. Your changes must be approved and published by the Customer Education team before they can go live.
