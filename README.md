# Learn Kontent - Code Samples

This repository contains code samples used in the [Kontent Docs](https://docs.kontent.ai/) portal.

## How To Contribute

Open a new issue where you describe your proposed changes, or create a pull request from your branch with proposed changes.

Each code sample is specified by a DocSection identifier. See examples in the `DocSectionTemplate.txt` file. The DocSection identifier must be unique for each technology. 

If your changes are merged to the master branch, the new code is automatically processed by the [Kontent-Github Sync](https://github.com/KenticoDocs/kontent-docs-github-reader) service and pushed to the Kontent Docs project. The changes will not automatically appear in <https://docs.kontent.ai>. Your changes must be approved and published by the Kontent docs team before they can go live.
